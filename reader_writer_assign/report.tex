\section{Implementing Thread-safe linked list}          

	\subsection{Validity of the first test}
		
		The first test implemented will not fail duo do its verification. The test was written
		to catch up situations where the simultaneos change would generate a conflict case and
		the programming running end up in a \textit{deadlock}.
		This test is completely valid, but the \textit{deadlock} does not happens constantly with 
		this implementation so we may say that the test is not effective.

	\subsection{Analyzing the first test output}

		Output:

		\begin{lstlisting}
Thread nmbr 0, won.
Thread nmbr 1, won.
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.040ms, TYPE : BEGIN WRITE
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.041ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.041ms, TYPE : BEGIN READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.041ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.041ms, TYPE : BEGIN WRITE
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.041ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.041ms, TYPE : BEGIN READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : BEGIN WRITE
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : BEGIN READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : BEGIN WRITE
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.042ms, TYPE : BEGIN READ
THREAD 0 TIME: +0s 0.043ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 1 TIME: +0s 0.094ms, TYPE : BEGIN WRITE
THREAD 1 TIME: +0s 0.097ms, TYPE : END READ
THREAD 1 TIME: +0s 0.097ms, TYPE : BEGIN READ
THREAD 1 TIME: +0s 0.098ms, TYPE : END READ   
		\end{lstlisting}

		The consistency of the call can be analyzed looking at three parameters: the identifier of 
		the thread, type of the call and the order in which they appear in the output.

		For instance, using this output we may infer that there is two threads (and the subject says 
		that to us:), analysing the thread 0 (zero) it's possible to see that between write operations
		it's possible to have read operations.

	\subsection{Naive implementation, using mutexes}

		\lstinputlisting[language=C]{reader_writer_1.c}

	\subsection{Naive implementation test}

		The scope of the test is:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Right after a \uppercase{br\_event\_id} \textbf{must} be an \uppercase{er\_event\_id}.
		\item Right after a \uppercase{bw\_event\_id} \textbf{must} be an \uppercase{ew\_event\_id}.
		\end{itemize}

		The code excerpt to perform such verification is below. 

		\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
void naive_tst(sevent_t events, int size){
	int x;
	for(x=0;x<size;x++){
		int event=events[x].event;
		int thread=events[x].thread;
		//In case of an ER/ER just ignore the line, 
		//they are going to be evaluated by BR/BW
		if(event==ER_EVENT_ID||event==EW_EVENT_ID) continue;
		//an event BR MUST BE followed by a ER
		if(event==BR_EVENT_ID){
			if(events[x+1].thread!=thread || events[x+1].event!=ER_EVENT_ID){
				printf("Test FAIL at line #%i!\n",x);
				exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
			}
		}	
		//an event BW MUST BE followed by a EW
		if(event==BW_EVENT_ID){
			if(events[x+1].thread!=thread || events[x+1].event!=EW_EVENT_ID){
				printf("Test FAIL at line #%i!\n",x);
				exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
			}
		}
	}
}		
		\end{lstlisting}

	\subsection{Efficiency of naive implementation}

		This kind of implementation has the same result as a serialization of all operations, since 
		only one thread can access the code at a time. That is the main reason why this kind of 
		implementation is safe.

\section{Improving concurrency}

	\subsection{Improving concurrency capability}

		\lstinputlisting[language=C]{reader_writer_2.c}

	\subsection{Improving concurrency test}

		The scope of the test is:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Right after a \uppercase{bw\_event\_id} \textbf{must} be an \uppercase{ew\_event\_id}.
		\item Between \uppercase{br\_event\_id} and \uppercase{er\_event\_id} \textbf{must not} exist \uppercase{bw\_event\_id} or \uppercase{ew\_event\_id}.
		\item There \textbf{must} exist at least two threads performing a reading (\uppercase{br\_event\_id}) at the same time.
		\end{itemize}

		The code excerpt to perform such verification is below. 

	\begin{lstlisting}
void concurrence_tst(sevent_t events, int size){
	int x;
	//counter for sequencial BR
	int seq_BR_counter=0;
	//counter for sequencial ER
	int seq_ER_counter=0;
	for(x=0;x<size;x++){
		int event=events[x].event;
		int thread=events[x].thread;
		if(event==ER_EVENT_ID||event==EW_EVENT_ID) continue;
		//Case an event begin read, the next must be end event end read for the same thread
		if(event==BR_EVENT_ID){
			int k=0;
			//There MUST NOT exist a write in reads
			for(k=x+1;k<size;k++){
				if(events[k].event==ER_EVENT_ID) break;		
				if(events[k].event==BW_EVENT_ID || events[k].event==EW_EVENT_ID ){
					printf("Test FAIL at line #%i\n",x);
					exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
				}
			}
			//Counts the sequencial readings
			if(events[x+1].event==event && event==BR_EVENT_ID){
				seq_BR_counter++;
			}
			if(events[x+1].event==event && event==ER_EVENT_ID){
				seq_ER_counter++;
			}
		}	
		//Case an event begin write, the next must be end event end write for the same thwrite
		if(event==BW_EVENT_ID){
			if(events[x+1].thread!=thread||events[x+1].event!=EW_EVENT_ID){
				printf("Test FAIL at line #%i!\n",x);
				exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
			}
		}
	}
	//MUST exist at least one multiple reading
	if(seq_BR_counter<2 && seq_ER_counter<2){
		printf("FAIL! No double readings, the output does not proof that multiples readings are allowed!\n");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}
	\end{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

As we can see in the output above, the Thread 1 just work in it's time slice in the line 7-10. All
others time slices belongs to the Thread 0, this characterize unfairness. Since two Threads do not
share the processor time in a fair manner.

\subsection{Fairness discusion}

Fairness is indeed an important topic in multiple programming. Usually the multiple programming
is solution for performance issues or even for better user expirience with the software. 
When the main issue is performance, we should be aware of the fairness situation and others problems related
to thread synchronization. 
This issue may affect the solution of the algorithm, turning it even into a bad solution, may be even worst
than a synchronized solution.

\subsection{Fairness solution}

Our fair solution can be seen in the code below.
